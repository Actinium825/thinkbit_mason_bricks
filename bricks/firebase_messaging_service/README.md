- User Permissions: Request and manage notification permissions.
- Token Handling: Retrieve and manage FCM tokens.

## Usage/Examples
Add this to main.dart after WidgetFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();


```javascript
Future<void> main() async {
    WidgetFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

    await Firebase.initializeApp(
        name: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform.projectId,
        options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
    );

    ...
}
```

Initialize FirebaseMessagingService.
```
final firebaseMessagingService = FirebaseMessagingService();
```

Use FirebaseMessaingService method/functions;
```
firebaseMessagingService
    ..initFirebaseMessaging()
    ..getFcmToken();
