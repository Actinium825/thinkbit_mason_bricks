## api_service

A brick created with the Mason CLI to generate api.dart file that can be used as api service of the app. Uses [dio][8] for http requests and integrated with [retry][9] for automatic request retries and [requests_inspector][10] to show the list of requests and responses made by the app by long pressing the empty space of the app or by shaking the device.

## Getting Started ðŸš€
1. Make sure Mason CLI is activated
`dart pub global activate mason_cli`
2. Initialize mason using this command inside your project root directory:
`mason init`
3. Add this brick to your project by editing the `mason.yaml` file and adding these lines under the `bricks`:
    ```
    api_service:
        git:
        url: https://github.com/thinkbit/thinkbit_mason_bricks.git
        path: bricks/api_service
    ```
4. Get the brick from the repository using this command:
`mason get`
5. Generate the code using this command:
`mason make api_service`
6. To implement [requests_inspector][10], edit the `main.dart` file:
    ```
    void main() {
        runApp(const RequestsInspector(
            child: MyApp(),
        ));
    }
    ```
    or the `bootstrap.dart` file if you are using verygood CLI to create your project:
    ```
    runApp(
        RequestsInspector(
            enabled: true,
            child: await builder(),
        ),
    );
    ```
